# H100 Confidential Computing

## Setup

Follow the NVIDIA [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cc-deployment-guide-tdx.pdf), notice that currently Intel has removed the original ``tdx-tools`` repo, we use a backup version for ``tag:2023ww15``, and the repo we use can be found at [src1](https://github.com/jialeif/tdx-tools), [src2](https://github.com/dimstav23/tdx-tools), and [src3](https://github.com/kenplusplus/tdx-tools).

Due to the server environment we have, we don't have fully ``root`` access to it, therefore, for some data movement during building the kernel, there will be permission problem and leads to failure.

We use a docker container to build all the needed packages for TDX, similiar to [src1](https://github.com/jialeif/tdx-tools). But we tested mount TDX sources in both host and docker, there will still be premission issue, then we decide to compile all packages inside docker only. When packages and kernel images are ready, we copy them back to host.
